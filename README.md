# Project Name
> The project is to predict the demand of the bike sharing business. There are multiple fastors that are listed in the dataset that are found to be affecting the Demand
> The Data provided is for 2 years 2018 and 2019
> We are trying to buuild a linear regression ML model that will help us understand variable that are highly affecting the demand

## Problem Statement
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

- It is seen that the US based company has taken a hit in their revenue recently due to the pandemic. It seems to be difficult for the company to manage in the current scenario.
- We have been given the data for the years 2018 and 2019
- Factors are listed in the data set depending on factors like temp, season, month, dat of the week
- Depending on the data from the given years we are expected to build a Linear Regression ML model to predict the demand by splitting the data in train and test data.

## Conclusions
- From the Model built, we can see that temp is a variable that affects the demand in bike
- Season of the year is a factor affecting the demand
- The major demand of bikes is seen in the seasons of Summer and Fall
- Also, demand is more in the weekday than a weekend/holiday
